# Backend for SmartBiz.AI

This folder is for the backend code to be deployed on Render. Place your server code (e.g., Express, FastAPI, etc.) here.

## Recommendations
- Store your API keys and secrets in environment variables, not in code.
- Add a .env file for local development and add it to .gitignore.
- Example structure:
  - backend/
    - index.js (or main.py)
    - package.json (for Node.js)
    - requirements.txt (for Python)
    - .env (not committed)

---

Let me know your backend stack (Node.js, Python, etc.) and I can scaffold the backend for you!
